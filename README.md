# Tiktok Live Port Project

Currently tiktok can only run the android version on Linux(and other non windows systems) through waydroid(or other emulators/compatibility layers. This is not the right app for streaming.

This is where the thought of what if you could get the windows EXE working on Linux?

So far I have only gotten the exe to post past the login and to the live screen but not gotten audio figured out nor video from the camera on my machine.

SO steps taken:
1.Use lutris to install exe,
2.removing from lutris container the installed files
3.put them into steam and use different proton types(no result audio and video from my machine fail, i am using arch linux on latest. laptop is semi modern.)
4.put them back into lutris and try proton GE latest(audio and video still do not post.
If anyone figures out a way on arch linux to get the applications EXE to see my camera and microphone let me know. Thank you!
